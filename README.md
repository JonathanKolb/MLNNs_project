# MLNNs_project

The idea for the project is to try out different algorithms from Machine Learning and Neural Networks on the Titanic dataset.

- [x] Replicate the original [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jamesleslie/titanic-neural-network-for-beginners/notebook)
- [x] updated deprecated dependencies in the meantime
- [ ] Use Logistic Regression
- [ ] Use Random Forest
- [ ] Use SVC


## Data

- Based on the Titanic competition with the following data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data
