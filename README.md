# MLNNs_project

The idea for the project is to try out different algorithms from Machine Learning and Neural Networks on the Titanic dataset.

- [x] Replicate the original [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jamesleslie/titanic-neural-network-for-beginners/notebook)
- [x] updated deprecated dependencies in the meantime
- [x] Use Logistic Regression
- [x] Use Random Forest
- [x] Use SVC
- [ ] Also visualize the learning rate
- [ ] Grid search for other classifiers
- [ ] Crossvalidation
- [ ] Validate the neural network grid search results with test data
- [ ] XAI
- [ ] Hyperparameter optimization
- [ ] MAybe do some clustering?


## Data

- Based on the Titanic competition with the following data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data
